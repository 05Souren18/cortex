Project Frankenstein is an API compatible [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
implementation, that natively supports multitenancy and scale-out clustering.

Project Frankenstein is the internal codename for the project inside [Weaveworks](https://weave.works),
where it forms a major part of [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works).  If
you are interested in using our hosted Prometheus as a service, please contact
[help@weave.works](mailto:help@weave.works).
